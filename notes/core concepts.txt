history:
-2000s: google system crashes
-2014: google launched borg which could auto heal the applications, scale them, distribute the load, etc
-2014: borg was made open source and then turned into "kubernetes", also called "k8s"
-present: kubernetes is used for the orchestration of docker containers 

orchestration tool:
-handling and managing the docker containers in an environment which allows them to communicate with eact other, heal them, 
auto scale, load distribution, etc. 

need of orchestration:
-we slowly move from monolith from microservice in order to have advantages 
-for managing a microservice architecture, we will have to manage all the applications and services in it 
-managing all the services in the architecture, which are in the form of docker containers, will require some orchestration tool 

some terms:
-node = single server/computer/machine
-cluster = multiple nodes or a group of machines or computers
-slave node = dependent node, which is run by some other node 
-master node = independent node, which is responsible for running the other nodes 
-pod: inside a slave node, there are a lot of docker containers running and the group of these containers is called pod

components of master node:
-API Server: communication gateway, keeping care of the communication happening between the slave nodes and the master 
-Scheduler: schedules the docker containers according to the need of the system
-etcd: a database containing the information about everything related to the docker containers and everything else 
which is present on the kubernetes
-Controller Manager: Sees whether everything is going on fine or what 

components of slave node:
-kubelet: manages the containers running in the node and other services, at the slave node level 
-service proxy: the docker containers are isolated from the outside world and we cant access them as a user directly, when we 
need to access them as an outside user, we use a service called service proxy












monolithic versus microservices
