observability contains the different aspects like monitoring, logging, tracing, alerting, for an application 

monitoring defines the different aspects which we monitor for our application via a tool 
logging refers to the collection of all the logs for the application
tracing refers to the sequential following of the logs and reaching the error and then solving it 
alerting refers to the process in which the tool alerts us in case of any anomaly occurs in the application 

there are tools which helps us to visualize all these aspects,for an application
the tools are:
prometheus: helps us to track the monitoring, logging, tracing
grafana: helps us to monitor these aspects in the form of a dashboard

prometheus is a time series database 
it has a scraping server which constantly scrapes the data from the application
it has a query server which queries the scraped data into the database and then the data is stored there in the form of a time series 
therefore, prometheus is a time series based database 
then the prometheus gives this time series based data to the grafana 
grafana thens makes dashboards and plots for this data and provides us visualization for the data
