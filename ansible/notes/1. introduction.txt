ansible is a configuration management tool 

problem with configuration management and infrastructure management:
at the large scale, management of the configuration and creation of infrastructure is very difficult if we attempt 
to do it manually and hence we require a tool which can automate the entire process and this tool is called the 
configuration management tool and one of those tools in the market is ansible 

ansible helps us to manage multiple environments (developement and production)
ansible helps us to manage multiple cloud systems (aws, azure, gcp)

terraform is used to create or provision infrastructure
ansible is used to manage the infrastructure or configuration

pull based approach:on a single machine, the ansible is installed and this machine pulls the initial configurations from
all the other machines and then updates the machines (e.g., chef)
push based approach:on a single machine, the ansible is installed and this machine pushes the updates to all other machines
(e.g., ansible)
both are configuration management tools, but most used in ansible

the single machine with ansible is called the master machine 
the other machines which are updated is called the slave machines or nodes
