a playbook is a .yml file which contains all the automation steps/tasks/stages/pipelines/etc. which should be executed by the
master machine on the slave machines 
we can create multiple playbooks on the master machine

creating the playbook:
create the playbook with the .yml extension and the name of the file can be anything (e.g., date_playbook.yml)

writing the playbook: 
-
    name: Dates playbook 
    hosts: servers
    tasks: 
        - name: Show Date
          command: date
    
        - name: Show Time
          command: time

running the playbook:
ansible-playbook date_playbook.yml

seeing the changes on the nodes:
1. go the node console and see (we can use the ssh connection for this)
2. use the playbook command with verbose (verbose shows the things which happens on the terminal)
ansible-playbook -v date_playbook.yml

the end
