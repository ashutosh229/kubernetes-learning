terraform is the IAC tool
IAC refers to Infrastructure As Code
instead of creating the Infrastructure manually by using some public cloud provider, we can write the code and create the 
complex infrastructure easily programmatically

this matters because manual labour in infrastructure development have a lot of issues and need to be solved 
and therefore we came up with the automation idea using terraform 

terraform is an iac tool for creating the infrastructure
ansible is an iac tool for the configuration management of the created infrastructure
configuration management refers to the management of the properties of the infrastructure and taking care of things like
software installations and all 

cloudformation is the iac for the aws
terraform can be used for any cloud provider service 

installing terraform on ec2 instance and local machine 

terraform, since it is a infrastructure as a code tool, requires coding 
coding is done in a langauge 
the language here is called HCL i.e. hashicorp configuration language
