throttle builds: stops at some time

concurrent builds: parallel builds 

build triggers: (what is the thing which triggers a build)
remote build triggers (via scripts)
dependency build (build after other projects are build)
periodic builds (builds are triggered at regular periods of time, using cron jobs)
github hook trigger for gitscm pooling (build triggered when action takes place on github)
poll scm (build trigger via polls)

build steps: (during a single build, what steps will be involved)
you can multiple steps in a single build 
there are multiple type of steps involved 
the type can be the execution of a windows batch command, shell execution, invoke ant, invoke gradle script, etc.
