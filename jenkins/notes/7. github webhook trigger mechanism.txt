while dealing with the integration of the github projects with jenkins, it is very important to understand that there 
should be some mechanim of build trigger via github 
i mean when the commit is made on the github, the pipeline job build is automatically triggered on the jenkins
this type of build trigger is called github hook trigger for gitscm pooling 

this mechanism of build trigger is carried out by webhooks 

if we do not use the build trigger via webhooks, then we have to first push the code to github and then manually perform 
the build using the GUI of the jenkins master on the master machine, running on the host machine

if we use the build trigger mechanism via webhooks, we have to push the code to github and then via the webhooks then jenkins 
will automatically detect the commit/push amd then run the build automatically
