while dealing with the integration of the github projects with jenkins, it is very important to understand that there 
should be some mechanim of build trigger via github 
i mean when the commit is made on the github, the pipeline job build is automatically triggered on the jenkins
this type of build trigger is called github hook trigger for gitscm pooling 

this mechanism of build trigger is carried out by webhooks
