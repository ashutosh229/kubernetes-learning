we dont do everything on the single jenkins server 

in the industry, there is a jenkins server which acts as the master 
there are other servers/nodes which acts as slaves 
these slaves, when ordered by the master, perform the jobs 
therefore, the job is not performed by jenkins but the slave nodes
which means we write the jobs on slave nodes 
this is called the master slave architecture

the jenkins master machine need to have jenkins and java both 
the jenkins agent machine need to have java for running jenkins but dont need jenkins 

the connection between the jenkins master and the slave is maintained via ssh
