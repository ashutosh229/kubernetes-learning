we dont do everything on the single jenkins server 

in the industry, there is a jenkins server which acts as the master 
there are other servers/nodes which acts as slaves 
these slaves, when ordered by the master, perform the jobs 
therefore, the job is not performed by jenkins but the slave nodes
which means we write the jobs on slave nodes 
this is called the master slave architecture

the jenkins master machine need to have jenkins and java both 
the jenkins agent machine need to have java for running jenkins but dont need jenkins 

the connection between the jenkins master and the slave is maintained via ssh
the ssh connection between two devices is done via the private and public key 
we generate the keys on the master device 
keep the private key on the master device 
transfer the public key on the slave device

node creation in jenkins master:
the master itself creates the slave nodes for itself 
node creation involves multiple steps:
name of the node
type of the node (permanent node or not)
description of the node 
number of executors (number of jobs which can run in it at once)
remote root directory (if any references are made during the build to the directory, then this will be treated as the root)
