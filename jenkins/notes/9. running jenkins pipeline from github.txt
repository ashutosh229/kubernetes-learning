you dont need to change the pipeline always from the jenkins gui 

you can go to the project repository on github 
make a Jenkinsfile
write the entire pipeline into the jenkins file 

since the pipeline is present in the jenkins file, we have to inform jenkins about it 
go to the jenkins and change the pipeline definition from pipeline script to pipeline from scm
then enter all the configurations needed and the system is ready now 

now you dont need to change the pipeline from the gui always and you can do it directly in your project directory
